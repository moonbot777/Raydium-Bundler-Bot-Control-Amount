## üìã Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Template

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of the changes made.

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature

- [ ] Tested on devnet
- [ ] Tested on mainnet
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests added (if applicable)

## Breaking Changes
- [ ] Yes (describe changes)
- [ ] No

```

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks** - Ensure all CI checks pass
2. **Code Review** - Address any feedback from maintainers
3. **Testing** - Verify changes work as expected
4. **Merge** - Once approved, changes will be merged

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Debugging

- Use `console.log()` for debugging (remove before PR)
- Check transaction logs in Solana Explorer
- Verify RPC endpoint connectivity
- Test with small amounts first

## üö® Security Considerations

- **Never commit private keys** - Always use environment variables
- **Test on devnet first** - Never test new features on mainnet initially
- **Validate inputs** - Always validate user inputs and configuration
- **Error handling** - Implement proper error handling for all operations
